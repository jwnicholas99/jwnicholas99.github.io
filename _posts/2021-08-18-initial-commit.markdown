This is certainly a first for me. Besides a [half-baked attempt](http://jwnicholas99-hci.blogspot.com/) years ago (as part of a school project), I have never been into blogging. While I'm not entirely sure why I decided to start blogging, I think it's an amalgation of the desire to improve my writing, the yearning for a (digital) voice and an attempt to build a [Second Brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb).

I hope to share my thoughts on both technical and non-technical topics I find interesting and/or important. Shoot me an email [@jwnicholas99@gmail.com](mailto: jwnicholas99@gmail.com) if there's anything you want to discuss about!
