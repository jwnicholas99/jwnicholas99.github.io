Publication: [Skill Discovery for Exploration and Planning using Deep Skill Graphs](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=-mvAo5hWNp), ICML 2020 LifelongML

Engaged in reinforcement learning research using Deep Skill Graphs to reduce large continuous MDPs into small discrete MDPs. Researched methods like Local Graph Partitioning to aid agent exploration in complex environments, eg. Montezumaâ€™s Revenge. Currently extending Relative Novelty to large, continuous state spaces using Random Network Distillation.
